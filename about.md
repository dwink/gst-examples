I think [GStreamer][gstreamer] is awesome. It's capable, complete, versatile, and yet has a reasonable command-line which lets you explore a wide swath of common cases with ease. Unfortunately, it also can have a significant learning curve to get past the most basic use cases, and I have been frustrated to find very little guidance to ease folks into the system via my language of choice, [Python][python].

So here we are. This site will include the best working examples I have of doing various things with and around GStreamer, using python 3 and the gobject-introspection bindings.
